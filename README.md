wp-log-in-browser
=================

Allows you to log data from your PHP WordPress code to your browser's console.

(a.k.a Annoyed you can't var_dump from an AJAX handler? Not anymore!)

I'm working on a nice admin screen to config auto-logging of some common things (like wp_query in pre_get_posts and wp), and some other goodies.

To log things manually, you can use:

    browser()->log( $var, $label );
    browser()->warn( $var, $label );
    browser()->info( $var, $label );
    browser()->error( $var, $label );

Also, commandas are chainable:

    browser()->log( 'This is a log...' )->error( '...and this is an error' );

For example, to log all your main query's query_vars:

    add_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'log_wp_query', 10000 );

    function log_wp_query( $query ) {
        if ( $query->is_main_query() )
            browser()->log( $query->query_vars, 'pre_get_posts' );

        return $query;
    }

Profiling
---------

The plugin includes a really simple function to allow you to track execution time of different parts of your code.

    browser()->timer( $key, $log = false );

The first time you call this function with a given $key (string) it will start a timer, and return false. You can start as many timers as you want, using different $key values. You can ignore the second parameter for this first call.

The second time you call this function with a given $key, it will return the ellapsed time in seconds since you started this $key timer. If you set the second parameter to true, it will also log this value to the browser.

Example 1: Sequential use, log manually.

    browser()->timer( 'Mega loop' );
    for ( $i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i++ ) {
        //do something
    }
    $time = browser()->timer( 'Mega loop' );
    browser()->log( $time, 'The mega loop took:' );

Example 2: Start and end in different places, log automatically.

    add_action( 'posts_selection', 'start_timer', 100 );
    add_filter( 'the_posts', 'end_timer', 1, 2 );

    function start_timer( $query ) {
        browser()->timer( 'Main query time' );
    }

    function end_timer( $posts, $query ) {
        browser()->timer( 'Main query time', true );
        return $posts;
    }

*This is not a good way of measuring how much time a query takes to run, it's just to illustrate how to use the timer.*

Installation
------------

For Chrome you need to install the [ChromePHP](http://www.chromephp.com/) extension.
For Firefox you need to install both the [FireBug](http://getfirebug.com/) and [FirePHP](http://www.firephp.org/) extensions.

And then...

1. Clone this repository in your wp-content/plugins folder
2. Make sure you **init and update the submodules**
3. Activate in your WordPress admin as any other plugin

Filters
-----------

**wplinb-match-wp-debug**: Set to true to only log when wp_debug is true. To prevent logging when wp_debug is false:

    add_filter( 'wplinb-match-wp-debug', '__return_true' );

**wplinb-enabled**: To disable logging completely. It takes precedence over *wplinb-match-wp-debug*. To disable logging:

    add_filter( 'wplinb-enabled', '__return_false' );
