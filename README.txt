Allows you to log data from your PHP WordPress code to your browser's console.

Annoyed you can't var_dump from an AJAX handler? Not anymore!

== Description ==

I'm working on a nice admin screen to config auto-logging of some common things (like wp_query in pre_get_posts and wp), and some other goodies.

To log things manually, you can use:

´browser()->log  ( $var, $label );´
´browser()->warn ( $var, $label );´
´browser()->info ( $var, $label );´
´browser()->error( $var, $label );´

Also, commandas are chainable:

´browser()->log( 'This is a log...' )->error( '...and this is an error' );´

For example, to log all your main query's query_vars:

´´´add_filter( 'pre_get_posts', 'log_wp_query', 10000 );

function log_wp_query( $query ) {
	if ( $query->is_main_query() )
		browser()->log( $query->query_vars, 'pre_get_posts' );

	return $query;
}´´´

= Filters =

*wplinb-match-wp-debug*: Set to true to only log when wp_debug is true. To prevent logging when wp_debug is false:

add_filter( 'wplinb-match-wp-debug', '__return_true' );´

*wplinb-enabled*: To disable logging completely. It takes precedence over *wplinb-match-wp-debug*. To disable logging:

´add_filter( 'wplinb-enabled', '__return_false' );´

= Profiling =

The plugin includes a really simple function to allow you to track execution time of different parts of your code.

´browser()->timer( $key, $log = false );´

The first time you call this function with a given $key (string) it will start a timer, and return false. You can start as many timers as you want, using different $key values. You can ignore the second parameter for this first call.

The second time you call this function with a given $key, it will return the ellapsed time in seconds since you started this $key timer. If you set the second parameter to true, it will also log this value to the browser.

Example 1: Sequential use, log manually.

´´´browser()->timer( 'Mega loop' );
for ( $i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i++ ) {
	//do something
}
$time = browser()->timer( 'Mega loop' );
browser()->log( $time, 'The mega loop took:' );´´´

Example 2: Start and end in different places, log automatically.

´´´add_action( 'posts_selection', 'start_timer', 100 );
add_filter( 'the_posts', 'end_timer', 1, 2 );

function start_timer( $query ) {
	browser()->timer( 'Main query time' );
}

function end_timer( $posts, $query ) {
	browser()->timer( 'Main query time', true );
	return $posts;
}´´´

*This is not a good way of measuring how much time a query takes to run, it's just to illustrate how to use the timer.*

In exactly the same way, you can use the function

´Browser()->memory( $key, $log = false );´

to measure delta of memory consumption from your first call and your second call with the same $key.

Example:

´´´Browser()->memory( 'testing' );
$test = array();
for ( $i = 0; $i < 100; $i++ ) {
	$test[$i] = md5( rand( 1, $i ) );
}
Browser()->memory( 'testing', true );


Browser()->memory( 'testing' );
$test = array();
for ( $i = 0; $i < 10000; $i++ ) {
	$test[$i] = md5( rand( 1, $i ) );
}
Browser()->memory( 'testing', true );

For Firefox you need to install both the [FireBug](http://getfirebug.com/) and [FirePHP](http://www.firephp.org/) extensions.

1. Upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
